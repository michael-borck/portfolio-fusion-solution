**Due Date:** 23:59 Friday 11 April, 2025
**Weight:** 20% of total unit grade


## Overview

This assignment evaluates your ability to integrate web development fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with modern AI-assisted development techniques. You will create a responsive, accessible portfolio website showcasing your projects from Weeks 1-4. The assessment emphasises both your final product and **the process you undertake** to achieve it. Your critical thinking, problem-solving, and ability to work with AI as a collaborative tool are key evaluation areas.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion, you should be able to:

- Develop responsive, accessible web pages using semantic HTML and CSS.
- Apply core web design principles (Flexbox/Grid layouts, typography, color theory).
- Implement interactive features with JavaScript (form validation, event handling, DOM manipulation, fetching APIs).
- Utilise AI effectively to generate, debug, refine, and critically analyse code.
- Follow accessibility best practices (ARIA roles/attributes, semantic markup).
- Deploy a live site using GitHub and Netlify.
- Demonstrate a thoughtful, iterative development process with version control and reflective practice.

## Tasks

### 1. Portfolio Website Development

Create a responsive, multi-page portfolio site that includes **at minimum 5 pages**:

- **Home Page**: Introduction, professional profile, and navigation menu linking to individual project pages.
- **Project Pages** (at least 4): Embed each previously developed project:
  - Week 2: Basic Webpage (HTML & CSS)
  - Week 3: Rock Paper Scissors Game (Simple JS interactions)
  - Week 4: Flatland Business Advisor (DOM Manipulation)
  - Week 5: RSS Reader (API Call using Fetch API)

Each project must function fully within your portfolio site. While making previous projects responsive is the primary requirement, ensure all functionality works correctly. Implement consistent navigation patterns across all pages.

### 2. Technical Requirements

- **Semantic HTML**: Proper headings, navigation, main content, footers, and structured content.
- **CSS Layout and Styling**: Implement responsive design (mobile-first approach) with Flexbox or Grid, media queries, typography, and consistent color schemes.
- **JavaScript Interactivity**: Include basic interactive elements (e.g., responsive navigation menus, interactive UI, form validation).
- **Accessibility**: Meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards using ARIA attributes, semantic tags, and accessibility best practices.
- **Documentation**: Include appropriate code comments and a comprehensive README.md file.
- **No Frameworks Allowed**: You must only use **Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. External libraries or frameworks such as Bootstrap, jQuery, React, etc., are not permitted.

### 3. Responsiveness Extension Task

Some embedded projects may initially lack responsive design. As part of integrating projects into your portfolio, ensure all projects are responsive across devices.

### 4. AI Integration Task & Conversation Logs

- Use AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Claude) to generate an initial site template.
- Critically analyse AI-generated code and modify it to meet project requirements, particularly focusing on accessibility, responsiveness, and coding standards.
- Submit structured logs (PDF/Markdown) of your AI conversations, clearly highlighting:
  - A minimum of 3 significant AI exchanges (each exchange should demonstrate substantial problem-solving or development work)
  - Your original questions/prompts
  - AI responses
  - Your critical evaluation of the AI output (correctness, accessibility, responsiveness)
  - Meaningful follow-up questions demonstrating deeper analysis and refinement
  - Evidence of prompt engineering evolution (how you refined your prompts based on results)

### 5. Before/After Implementation Examples

Include at least 2 clear "before/after" examples that demonstrate:

- Initial AI-generated code
- Your improvements to the code
- Explanation of why your changes were necessary (e.g., accessibility issues, performance improvements, better responsiveness)

### 6. Deployment & Version Control

- Host your completed portfolio live using Netlify.
- Maintain regular, descriptive commits in your GitHub repository throughout development.
- Demonstrate an organised commit history with meaningful commit messages.

### Optional Bonus Task: Code Review & Future Improvements (up to +5%)

Submit a structured code review document (1-2 pages) that:

- Identifies at least 3 specific areas of your own code that could be improved
- Explains potential technical solutions for these improvements
- Provides a prioritised roadmap for future enhancements
- Demonstrates technical understanding beyond what AI tools typically provide in code reviews

## Submission Requirements

1. Link to the live Netlify site.
2. ZIP archive of the GitHub repository.
3. Invite the instructor (Bentley: michael-borck) to the repository.
4. Submit a single PDF or Markdown document containing:
   - Complete structured logs of your AI conversations with critical analysis.
   - The required "before/after" implementation examples.
   - A brief reflection (200-300 words) on your design and coding decisions, challenges faced, and problem-solving approach.
   - Lessons learned about working with AI for development.
   - Any non-compliant issues
   - Optional: Code review document for bonus consideration.

## Important Notes

1. **Assessment Focus**: This assignment evaluates not just what you build, but how you build it. Simply generating a beautiful website with AI without demonstrating understanding and critical improvements will not achieve high marks.

2. **Iterative Development**: Show your development journey through your commits and reflection. Document your learning process, challenges, and solutions.

3. **AI as a Tool**: Use AI as a collaborative tool rather than a replacement for your own learning and development skills. The most successful projects will show thoughtful human intervention and improvement of AI-generated code.

4. **Encouragement to Exceed Minimum Requirements**:  
   _The minimum criteria provided here are designed to support your learning. You're encouraged to exceed these where possible, demonstrating deeper technical understanding and authentic critical thinking._

5. **Academic Integrity:** You are fully responsible for ensuring all submitted work is your own or clearly attributed. Any AI-generated content or external code used must be clearly documented, critically evaluated, appropriately paraphrased, and explicitly cited. Plagiarism or inappropriate reliance on AI-generated content will be treated seriously.

6. **Late Submissions**: Late submissions will incur penalties as per the unit outline. Extensions will only be granted in exceptional circumstances.
